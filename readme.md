Welcome to FarmersEdge code golf!

This project contains a few challenges meant to test your proficiency with Python and SQL.

Each Python file contains its own problem, with instructions for the desired solution. You can use any resources
available to you, save for modules; use only the standard library, except for when instructed otherwise.

Make your way through each file and solve each set of problems presented. Once you are done, zip up the entire project
directory and email it to your interviewer.

Completion is expected by end of business hours, same day of the personal interview section.

Good luck!
